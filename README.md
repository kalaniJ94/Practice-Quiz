# Practice-Quiz

## Description

This project was done in order to flex, and develop, new Javascript skills. It was an interesting journey, from conception, to psuedocoding, to deployment. 

My first, original, vision for the project was a set of functions that used innerHTML to affect and manipulate the text displaying in the <li>, using an event listener to listen for a click on the correct box, and then calling the next question function. I got very close using this method, however the problem I kept running into was that the "wrong" box was never clickable. I had to rewrite this code as a looping function of arrarys, and I am very happy with the final project. 

I learned so many important lessons regarding JS during this lesson, doubtless that I will utilize for the rest of my career.
